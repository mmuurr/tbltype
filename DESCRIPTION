Description:
    R isn't a statically-typed language, which confers great flexibility, but sometimes at the expense of runtime errors when dealing with data.
    This package allows you to specify the type of data you expect for a dataframe (or list), or more accurately: the type of data _downstream_ recipients of your lists and dataframes can reliably expect.
    Instead of specifying **types**, `tbltype` allows you to declaratively specify **casting** (or coercion) rules (via functions).
